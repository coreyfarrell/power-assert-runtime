empower : Power Assert feature enhancer for assert function/object
================================


DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------
`empower` is a core module of `power-assert` family. `empower` enhances standard `assert` function or any assert-like object to work with power-assert feature added code instrumented by `espower`. `empower` module also provides a default formatter for power-assert output.

`empower` works with standard `assert` function (best fit with [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)), and also supports assert-like objects provided by various testing frameworks such as [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com/) or [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit).

Please note that `empower` is an alpha version product. Pull-requests, issue reports and patches are always welcomed.

See [power-assert](http://github.com/twada/power-assert) project for more documentation.
